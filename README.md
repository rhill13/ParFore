# MobileAppProject

Hey guys! So this is the README.md file. This is basically just a txt document explaining the app we are going to make. We can also add some "How Tos" to this file if anyone needs to remember how to do something. <br>

This document also accepts markup just like html:

<ul>
  <li>This is an unordered list (ul).</li>
  <li>This is a list item!</li>
  <li>This as well...</li>
  <li><a href='https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/'>Here</a> is a guide for markdown if you need it!</li>
</ul>
